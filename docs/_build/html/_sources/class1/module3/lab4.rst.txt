Declarative - Create VS, Pool and Members using App Services (AS3)
==================================================================

You will create a playbook to deploy VS, Pools and associated Members using App Services.

**Create app services using playbook using AS3**

#. Examine playbook ``service_4.yaml``
   - Type ``nano playbooks/service_4.yaml``

   .. NOTE::

     This playbook uses **roles** which contain their own vars, files and tasks. Grouping content by roles allows easy sharing of playbooks with other users.  You may examine the files in roles/service_4 directory.

#. Run this playbook.

   - Type ``ansible-playbook playbooks/service_4.yaml -e @creds.yaml --ask-vault-pass``

#. Verify results in BIG-IP GUI.
#. From the BIG-IP GUI, select **Local Traffic->Virtual Servers** page.  Note there are no virtual servers listed.  You will need to select ``Service4`` partition on the top right to view the ``serviceMain`` service.
#. Select **serviceMain** then **Security->Polocies** and note the ``service_4_WAF`` created.

#. Run this playbook to teardown.

   - Type ``ansible-playbook playbooks/destroy_all_services.yaml -e @creds.yaml --ask-vault-pass``

#. Verify results in BIG-IP GUI.

.. NOTE::

  Roles are ways of automatically loading certain vars_files, tasks, and handlers based on a known file structure. Grouping content by roles also allows easy sharing of roles with other users.
